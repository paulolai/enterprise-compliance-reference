# Stakeholder Guide to Executable Specifications

**A handbook for Product Owners, Business Analysts, and Compliance Officers.**

> *Stop reading Feature Files. Start reading Evidence.*

## 🛑 The Old Way (The "Manual Attestation Tax")

In traditional environments (like many banks and enterprises), the "Verification Loop" is painful and manual:
1.  **Manual Screenshots:** Capturing Postman screenshots for every API endpoint.
2.  **The Word Doc Grind:** Pasting screenshots into Word documents to prove "the code works."
3.  **ServiceNow/Jira Uploads:** Manually uploading these files into ServiceNow or Zephyr for release approval.
4.  **The "Sync" Gap:** Requirements change in Confluence, but the manual test artifacts are already out of date.
5.  **Audit Pain:** Creating a "Release Attestation" requires scraping data from three different tools (Jira, ServiceNow, TeamCity).

## ✅ The New Way (Continuous Attestation)

With **Executable Specifications**, the "Report" is not a document someone writes; it is an artifact the system generates.

### 1. How to Review Quality (No Engineering Knowledge Required)

You don't need to read code or "Gherkin" feature files. You only need to check the **Attestation Report**.

**What to do:**
1.  Click the link engineers share (generated by the Build Pipeline).
2.  Look for the **Requirement Traceability Matrix**.
    *   This table maps every **Business Rule** (from the Strategy Doc) directly to the **Evidence** (Test Results).
3.  Click on any rule to see the **Detailed Audit Log**.

**What you'll see in the Audit Log:**
```text
Safety Valve (Revenue Protection @critical)
Protects revenue by capping discounts at 30%

Edge Cases Covered:
• Large orders ($5K items, 20+ qty) - verified 89 times
• VIP customers with bulk discounts - verified 142 times
• Combined discounts (bulk + VIP) - verified 289 times

Status: ✅ Confirmed protecting revenue in 520 test cases
```

### 2. Filter by What Matters

The report is tagged for your role:
-   **@revenue-protection** (For Finance/Product): Are we giving away too much margin?
-   **@compliance** (For Risk/Audit): Are we meeting regulatory constraints?
-   **@customer-experience** (For UX/Product): Are we delivering the promised value?

### 3. How to Request Changes (The "Zero-Meeting" Flow)

When you want to change logic (e.g., "Raise free shipping to $150"):

1.  **Open a Request:** Create a simple issue or comment.
2.  **We Update the Strategy:** Engineers update `docs/pricing-strategy.md`.
3.  **We Show Impact:** We run the tests *before* writing code. The report will show:
    *   "⚠️ 12% of existing carts now fail to get free shipping."
4.  **You Approve:** You see the data and say "Go."
5.  **We Deploy:** The system updates, and the **Attestation Report** is automatically generated for the release.

**Total Admin Time:** ~5 minutes.
**Jira/Zephyr Updates:** 0 (The code *is* the record).

## 🧐 Glossary for Stakeholders

| Term | Traditional Equivalent | In This Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy Document** | Confluence Requirements | `docs/pricing-strategy.md` (Living Doc) |
| **Invariant** | Business Rule | A test that checks *all* scenarios, not just one |
| **Attestation Report** | Manual Zephyr Report | Auto-generated HTML Audit Trail |
| **Edge Case** | "What if...?" scenario | Automatically generated by the system (thousands per run) |
